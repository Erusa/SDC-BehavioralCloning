# SDC-BehavioralCloning
My own Project from SDC Udacity Course, which drives autonomously a car, using deep neural networks.

In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. You will train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle. It uses a simulator from Udacity.

Repository includes:
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* writeup.md (report writeup file)
* run1.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)
* loss.png (training and validation loss)
* drive.py and video.py (script to drive the car)(from Udacity)
* ...
