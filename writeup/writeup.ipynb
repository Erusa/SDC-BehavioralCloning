Because, I notice that best performance is reached by 2-3 Epochs, I tried to avoid underfitting by adding 1-2 Dropout layer and compare performance, deciding to use only one Dropout Layer. I notice that the car always go outside the way at the same position, and because of that, I save extra training information on that position. For final adjustments, I played with different batch sizes by training.\n",

I added to correction factor to the steering angle, because I consider that the angle changes depending on the curvature of the road. Following code was used:"
